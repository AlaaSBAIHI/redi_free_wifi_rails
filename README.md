# Learn how to build an Android Application and a Rails backend

**Project for [REDI School Berlin](http://redi-school.org)**

## Lesson 1 - Create your first Rails backend

### 1. Create new rails project

In your shell, go in the repository where you store all your dev project. The following command will create a new directory.

We will use PostgreSQL as a database because it's a default database used on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

````bash
# Create the new project with the command rails
rails new redi_free_wifi_rails -d postgresql

# Go in the new directory created
cd redi_free_wifi_rails

# See the new created files
ls -l
````

### 2. Commit your code on Github

You will save your code on Github. There your code is safe and you can share it with anyone.

 - Create a new Repository on [Github](https://github.com): [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
 - Define a repository name `redi_free_wifi_rails` and click on `Create repository`
 - Go back to your shell and write the following commands

 ````bash
 echo "# redi_free_wifi_rails" >> README.md
 git init
 git add .
 git commit -m "Initialize my first Rails application"
 # /!\ Be careful, you HAVE TO replace the command below with the url of you own repository /!\
 git remote add origin git@github.com:jameslafa/redi_free_wifi_rails.git
 git push -u origin master
 ````

### 3. Set Rspec as the default testing framework

Rspec is a testing framework. We will start building tests in the next lesson but it's important to set it from the beginning of the project.

Of the name named `Gemfile` and add the following line `gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.5'` in the block `:development, :test`.

It should look like this:

````
group :development, :test do
  # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console
  gem 'byebug', platform: :mri
  # Use rspec as a testing framework
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.5'
end
````

After saving the file, go back to your shell.

````bash
# Add the new Gem (package for ruby development)
bundle install

# Initialize Rspec
rspec:install

# Check you have the new directory spec created
ls -l

# Delete the unnecessary folder test
rm -rf test
````

As soon as we made a significant change, we commit a new version of the code. In case something goes bad, we can always easily go back at this specific point.

````bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Install Rspec'
git push
````

### 4. Create a database user (unnecessary under OSX)

This is for linux users only. On Mac OSX the database does not require authentication locally.

We need to create a database user and setup the credentials in our rails application.

In your shell, execute the following commands:

````bash
# Change to the postgres user. It requires the root password. If you use the Vagrant image we created for you, it's redischool.
su - postgres

# Create the new database user
create role redi_free_wifi_rails with createdb login password 'redi_free_wifi_rails';
````

We now need to set our database user credentials in rails.

Edit the file `config/database.yml`

Edit the `development` and `test` configuration as described below:

````yaml
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: redi_free_wifi_development
  pool: 5
  username: redi_free_wifi_rails
  password: redi_free_wifi_rails

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: redi_free_wifi_test
  pool: 5
  username: redi_free_wifi_rails
  password: redi_free_wifi_rails
````

### 5. Create a venue scaffold

Our application with be the backend of an Android application which will display a list of venues offering free wifi. It could be bars, restaurants, co-working places, etc.

A venue will have the following attributes:
  - name
  - description
  - category (bar, restaurant, co-working space)
  - latitude (geo-coordinates)
  - longitude (geo-coordinates)

Our Android application will be able to list the venues around us, create new one, edit existing one and later search for venues.

We're going to create a Scaffold which will automatically create everything that we need to do that. Later we'll learn out to create all this manually.

Go back to your shell and execute the following command.
````bash
rails generate scaffold Venue name:string description:text category:integer latitude:float longitude:float
````

This is creating many files, we're going to learn together what are they used for.

````
create    db/migrate/20161025070502_create_venues.rb
create    app/models/venue.rb
invoke    rspec
create      spec/models/venue_spec.rb
invoke  resource_route
 route    resources :venues
invoke  scaffold_controller
create    app/controllers/venues_controller.rb
invoke    erb
create      app/views/venues
create      app/views/venues/index.html.erb
create      app/views/venues/edit.html.erb
create      app/views/venues/show.html.erb
create      app/views/venues/new.html.erb
create      app/views/venues/_form.html.erb
invoke    rspec
create      spec/controllers/venues_controller_spec.rb
create      spec/views/venues/edit.html.erb_spec.rb
create      spec/views/venues/index.html.erb_spec.rb
create      spec/views/venues/new.html.erb_spec.rb
create      spec/views/venues/show.html.erb_spec.rb
create      spec/routing/venues_routing_spec.rb
invoke      rspec
create        spec/requests/venues_spec.rb
invoke    helper
create      app/helpers/venues_helper.rb
invoke      rspec
create        spec/helpers/venues_helper_spec.rb
invoke    jbuilder
create      app/views/venues/index.json.jbuilder
create      app/views/venues/show.json.jbuilder
create      app/views/venues/_venue.json.jbuilder
invoke  assets
invoke    coffee
create      app/assets/javascripts/venues.coffee
invoke    scss
create      app/assets/stylesheets/venues.scss
invoke  scss
create    app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.scss
````

````bash
# Create development and test database
rails db:create

# Create the new venues Table
rails db:migrate

# Run rails server
rails server
````

You can now open your browser on the following url [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It should display a nice page showing *Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!*.

Now even more interesting, we can go on [http://localhost:3000/venues](http://localhost:3000/venues) and start to list, create, edit and delete venues.

It's time to commit our code.

````bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Create a new Venue Scaffold'
git push
````
